## 🔴 CRITICAL ITEMS TO COMPLETE

### 1. Environment Detection System ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ **DONE**
- [x] Add `ENVIRONMENT` variable to `.env` (values: `testnet` | `mainnet`)
- [x] Create `pkg/config/environment.go` with environment detection
- [x] Update all environment checks to use centralized config
- [x] Add runtime validation on startup

**Completed Files**:
- ✅ `.env` - Added `ENVIRONMENT=testnet`
- ✅ `.env.mainnet` - Added `ENVIRONMENT=mainnet`
- ✅ `internal/services/deai_service.go` - Uses config instead of hardcoded check
- ✅ `pkg/config/environment.go` - Centralized environment detection
- ✅ `main.go` - Startup validation

### 2. Frontend Safety Guards ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ **DONE**
- [x] Update frontend to check environment from backend config
- [x] Show dynamic stablecoin labels based on network
- [x] Add network requirement warning in deposit modal
- [x] Add link to bridge documentation
- [x] Dynamic icons (USDT/USDC) based on network

**Completed Files**:
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/wallet/wallet.tsx` - Deposit modal with warning
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/wallet/StablecoinIcon.tsx` - Dynamic icon component
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/wallet/HomeContent.tsx` - Dynamic labels
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/wallet/components/rewards/RevenueShareSection.tsx` - Dynamic labels
- ✅ `frontend/src/config/network.ts` - Helper functions
- ✅ TypeScript bindings regenerated

**Note**: Test token minting is backend-controlled and already blocked on mainnet via environment check.

### 3. Deployment Scripts ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Status**: 🟡 **Makefile targets exist, but need mainnet-specific variants**

**Current State**:
- [x] `contracts-deploy-testnet` exists (generic, works for any network)
- [x] `contracts-deploy-mining-testnet` exists
- [x] `contracts-deploy-cashback-testnet` exists
- [x] `contracts-deploy-referral-testnet` exists
- [ ] Create mainnet-specific targets for clarity
- [ ] Add pre-deployment validation checks
- [ ] Document deployment process

**Note**: Existing testnet targets can be used for mainnet by changing `.env` file, but dedicated mainnet targets would be clearer and safer.

### 4. Contract Deployment

**Problem**: PaymentVault needs to be deployed with USDC address on mainnet
**Solution**: Deploy contracts to mainnet with correct addresses

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Review all contract constructor parameters
- [ ] Deploy `PaymentVault` to mainnet with USDC address
- [ ] Deploy all distributor contracts to mainnet
- [ ] Update `.env.mainnet` with deployed addresses
- [ ] Run `make constants-generate` to update Go constants
- [ ] Verify all contracts on MonadScan

**Contracts to Deploy**:
- [ ] `PaymentVault` (with USDC address)
- [ ] `MiningRewardDistributor`
- [ ] `CashbackDistributor`
- [ ] `ReferralDistributor`
- [ ] `KawaiToken` (if not already deployed)

### 5. Testing on Mainnet

**Problem**: Need to verify all functionality works with real USDC
**Solution**: Comprehensive mainnet testing

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Acquire test USDC on Monad Mainnet (small amount)
- [ ] Test deposit flow with real USDC
- [ ] Test approval flow
- [ ] Test balance checking
- [ ] Test reward claiming (if applicable)
- [ ] Monitor gas costs
- [ ] Test error handling

### 6. Monitoring & Alerts

**Problem**: Need to monitor mainnet operations
**Solution**: Set up monitoring and alerting

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Set up transaction monitoring
- [ ] Add error logging for failed transactions
- [ ] Monitor USDC balance in PaymentVault
- [ ] Set up alerts for low balance
- [ ] Monitor gas prices
- [ ] Track user deposits and withdrawals

---

## 🟡 RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Graceful Degradation

**Add fallback mechanisms**:
- [ ] Handle RPC failures gracefully
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed transactions
- [ ] Cache balance data to reduce RPC calls

- [ ] Add clear instructions for acquiring USDC
- [ ] Show bridge links (e.g., to bridge USDC from Ethereum)
- [ ] Display current USDC balance prominently
- [ ] Add transaction history
- [ ] Show pending transactions

### 3. Security Hardening

**Additional security measures**:
- [ ] Add rate limiting for deposits
- [ ] Implement maximum deposit limits (if needed)
- [ ] Add multi-sig for admin operations
- [ ] Audit all smart contracts before mainnet launch
- [ ] Set up emergency pause mechanism

### 4. User Experience ✅ COMPLETED

- USDC has 6 decimals, not 18 like most tokens
- Circle's USDC is the official USDC on Monad Mainnet
- Bridge from Ethereum may take time - inform users
